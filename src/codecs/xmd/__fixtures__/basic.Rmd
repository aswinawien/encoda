## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document [as created by RStudio]. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## With a figure

```{r figure3, fig.cap='(ref:figure-3)'}
# R code here
```

Some intermediary content

```{r figure4, fig.cap='(ref:figure-4)'}
# R code here but non-existent figure reference
```

And follow up with a duplicate figure reference

```{r figure3, fig.cap='(ref:figure-3)'}
# R code here
```
