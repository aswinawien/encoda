## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document [as created by RStudio]. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Using fig.cap option

```{r fig1, fig.width=8, fig.cap='A plot'}
plot(data)
```

```{r table2, fig.cap='A table'}
head(data)
```

## Using Bookdown-style fig.cap text references

```{r figure3, fig.cap='(ref:fig3)'}
# R code here
```

(ref:fig3) A caption for figure 3.

Some intermediary content

```{r figure4, fig.cap='(ref:figure-4)'}
# R code here but non-existent figure reference
```

And follow up with a duplicate figure reference

```{r fig5, fig.cap='(ref:fig3)'}
# R code here
```

(ref:fig3) **Distinct and dorsoventrally organized properties of layer 2 stellate cells.**(**A**) Representative action potential after hyperpolarization waveforms from a SC (left), a pyramidal cell (middle) and an unidentified cell (right). The pyramidal and unidentified cells were...
